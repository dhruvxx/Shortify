# Shortify

A transformer-based abstractive text summarization implemented in Python. 

### Analyzing the summarizations

The file `summarized_text.csv` contains a column with the article that was summarized. The column `summary` denotes the text that was produced by the script and the `highlights` column contains the highlight of the article as written by the article author. 

The dataset can be downloaded using:
```kaggle datasets download -d gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail```
